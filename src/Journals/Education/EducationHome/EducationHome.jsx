                    peer-reviewed international
                    journal published by The Brooklyn Research and Publishing Institute. The journal publishes research
                    manuscripts in the fields of education and human development which would be of interest to an international
                    readership. The aim of the journal is to publish high quality manuscripts that are of international
                    significance in terms of design and/or findings by encouraging the collaboration with international
                    teams of researchers to create special issues on these topics. The journal strives to strengthen
                    connections between research and practice, so enhancing professional development and improving
                    practice within the field of education and human development. Papers accepted for publication
                    are double-blind refereed to ensure academic integrity.

                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Education and Human Development</span>  provides a forum
                    for the publication of high quality
                    accounting research manuscripts. The journal attempts to assist in the understanding of
                    the present and potential ability of accounting to aid in the recording and
                    interpretation of international economic transactions and taxation practices.
                    The journal recognizes that international accounting is influenced by a
                    variety of forces i.e. governmental, political and economical.
