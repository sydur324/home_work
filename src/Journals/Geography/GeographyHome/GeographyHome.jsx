                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Geography and Earth Sciences</span>  is a double blind
                    peer reviewed
                    journal that publishes original research papers using analytical, empirical,
                    experimental, and field study methods in all areas of accounting research.

                    accounting and taxation. The contributions are welcomed across a wide range of
                    research methodologies (e.g. analytical, archival, experimental, survey and
                    qualitative case methods). Each paper will be judged according to international
                    standards within its topic area, the originality of its contribution,
                    its relevance to development of the subject and its quality of exposition.
                    All papers are subject to a minimum of double blind refereeing.
