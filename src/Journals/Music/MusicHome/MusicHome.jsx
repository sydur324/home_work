                    and a section containing extended book reviews which further current debates.
                    The journal strives to strengthen connections between research and practice,

                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>International Journal of Music and Performing Arts</span>  fosters conceptual and
                    technical innovations in abstract, systematic musical thought and cultivates the historical
                    study of musical concepts and compositional techniques. The journal publishes research with
                    important and broad applications in the analysis of music and the history of music theory as
                    well as theoretical or metatheoretical work that engages and stimulates ongoing discourse in
                    the field. While remaining true to its original formalist outlook, the journal also addresses
                    the influences of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, cognitive sciences, and anthropology
                    on music theory and performing arts.
