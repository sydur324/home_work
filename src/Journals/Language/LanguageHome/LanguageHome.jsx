                    reviewed journal covering the latest developments in stylistic analysis, the linguistic analysis of
                    literature and related areas. With its uniquely broad coverage, the journal offers readers easy
                    access to all the important new research relevant to stylistics. Refereed articles from
                    international scholars ensure that readers are kept fully up to date with the best
                    research worldwide. The journal also publishes notes and discussion that provides a
                    stimulating forum for debate on new and controversial contributions to the study of
                    language and literature. New publications in the field are surveyed and expert
                    reviews of the most important works are included.
