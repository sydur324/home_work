                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology</span>  provides a forum
                    for the publication of high quality
                    accounting research manuscripts. The journal attempts to assist in the understanding of
                    the present and potential ability of accounting to aid in the recording and
                    interpretation of international economic transactions and taxation practices.
                    The journal recognizes that international accounting is influenced by a
                    variety of forces i.e. governmental, political and economical.
