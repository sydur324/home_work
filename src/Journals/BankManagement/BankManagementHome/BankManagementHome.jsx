                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Finance and Bank Management</span>  serves both academics and
                    practitioners concerned with the financial management of nonfinancial businesses, financial
                    institutions, banks and public or private not-for-profit organizations. The journal publishes
                    theoretical and empirical research papers spanning all the major research fields in finance and
                    banking. It seeks to provide an outlet for the increasing flow of scholarly research concerning
                    financial institutions and the money and capital markets within which they function. The Journal's
                    emphasis is on theoretical developments and their implementation, empirical, applied, and policy-oriented
                    research in banking and other domestic and international financial institutions and markets. The Journal's
                    purpose is to improve communications between, and within, the academic and other research communities and
                    policymakers and operational decision makers at financial institutions - private and public, national and
                    international, and their regulators.
