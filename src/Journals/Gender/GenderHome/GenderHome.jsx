                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>International Journal of Gender and Women's Studies</span>  is an interdisciplinary
                    international journal which publishes articles relating to gender
                    and sex from a feminist perspective covering a wide range of subject
                    areas including the social and natural sciences, the arts,
                    the humanities and popular culture. The journal seeks articles
                    from around the world that examine gender and the social
                    construction of relationships among genders.
                    In drafting papers authors should consider
                    the readability of their paper for readers outside of their discipline.
                    Articles appearing in Journal of Gender
                    and Women’s Studies analyze gender and gendered processes in interactions,
                    organizations, societies, and global and transnational spaces.
                    The journal primarily publishes empirical articles,
                    which are both theoretically engaged and methodologically rigorous,
                    including qualitative, quantitative, and comparative methodologies.
                    The journal also publishes reviews of books from a diverse array of social science disciplines.
