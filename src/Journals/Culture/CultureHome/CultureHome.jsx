                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Islamic Studies and Culture</span>  is a peer reviewed
                    international scholarly journal published by The Brooklyn Research and Publishing Institute.
                    The journal is dedicated to the scholarly study of all aspects of Islam and of the Islamic world.
                    Particular attention is paid to works dealing with history, geography, political science, economics,
                    anthropology, sociology, law, literature, religion, philosophy, international relations,
                    environmental and developmental issues, as well as ethical questions related to
                    scientific research. The journal is committed to the publication of original
                    research on Islam as culture and civilization. It particularly welcomes work
                    of an interdisciplinary nature that brings together history, religion, politics,
                    culture and law. The Journal has a special focus on Islam in Africa,
                    and on contemporary Islamic Thought. Contributions that display theoretical
                    rigor especially work that link the particularities of Islamic discourse to
                    the enterprise of knowledge and critique in the humanities and social sciences,
                    will find Journal of Islamic Studies and Culture to be receptive to such submissions.
