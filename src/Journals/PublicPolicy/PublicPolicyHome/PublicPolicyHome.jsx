                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Public Policy and Administration Review</span>  is an international
                    peer-reviewed journal published by The Brooklyn Research and Publishing Institute.
                    The journal aims at exploring the latest developments in public administration and
                    management - translating theory for practice and practice into theory.
                    The journal is truly global in scope, covering developed, emerging and
                    transitional states and all areas of public activity.
                    It welcomes both individual country-based and especially
                    comparative work. The target audience is not just scholars,
                    but also policy-makers and practitioners, including aspiring
                    public sector leaders engaged in education and research in the growing global community.

                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Public Policy and Administration Review</span>  strives to draw on the latest
                    research - whether carried out by scholars or practitioners or indeed collaborations.
                    The journal includes not only cutting edge research, but also: feature interviews or
                    opinion pieces from leading scholars and policy-makers; a resources section for
                    scholars and practitioners; occasional symposia and debates; and themed issues of
                    topics of special interest. Proposals in all these areas are always welcome.
                    All research articles in this journal have undergone initial editorial screen
                    and rigorous peer review.
