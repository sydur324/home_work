                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Economics and Development Studies</span>  is an international
                    journal that effectively bridges the gap between academics, policy makers, and practitioners
                    and links the various economic development communities. The journal focuses on contemporary
                    research publication philosophies including blind strict peer refereeing, timely review,
                    regular publication and broader coverage of the field. The editorial board is represented
                    by the world's reputed and experienced academicians and researchers in the field of economics.
                    The blind peer review and editorial policies are largely contributed by the 'economics forum'
                    of American Association of International Researchers. The journal is completely open access
                    which has opened the doors for the millions of international readers and academicians to keep
                    in touch with the latest research findings in the field of economics and development studies.
