                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Review of History and Political Science (RHPS)</span>  is a
                    peer-reviewed international
                    journal published by The Brooklyn Research and Publishing Institute.
                    The RHPS is unique in its range and variety, packing its pages with
                    stimulating articles and extensive book reviews. The journal balances
                    its broad chronological coverage with a wide geographical spread of
                    articles featuring contributions from social, political, cultural,
                    economic and ecclesiastical historians. The journal also welcomes
                    contributions drawn from all fields of political science
                    (including political theory, political behavior, public
                    policy and international relations). Papers accepted for
                    publication are double-blind refereed to ensure academic integrity.
