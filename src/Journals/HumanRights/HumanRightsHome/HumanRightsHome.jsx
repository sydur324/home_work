                    <span className='font-medium text-[#91000D]'>Journal of Social Welfare and Human Rights</span>  serves as an arena for the
                    public discussion and scholarly analysis of human rights, broadly conceived. It seeks to broaden
                    the study of human rights by fostering the critical re-examination of existing approaches to
                    human rights, as well as to develop new perspectives on the theory and practice of human rights.
                    The journal provides the opportunity for the critical examination of the human rights community
                    and of the different visions of human rights and different practical strategies which exist
                    within that community. The editor welcomes papers from scholars and disciplines traditionally
                    associated with the study of human rights, as well as papers from those in other disciplines
                    or fields of inquiry which have traditionally been underrepresented in the field of human rights.
                    The journal follows double-blind peer review process.
